Image Filters for smoothing and edge enhancement

"Edge-preserving image smoothing, which smooths small details and preserves sharp edges.
The flexible weighted least-squares optimization framework achieves edge-preserving smoothing by minimizing gradients using edge-aware weights.
Edge-aware image smoothing methods have also been used for image and video abstraction."

LSFilter.py does not as powerful as the paper mentioned. 
Parameters beta and lamda are swapped and tuned to make it working.
Welcome to comment and discover more legendary image filters.
